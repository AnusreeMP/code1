#Dict:
#create dict in python:
# captial_city={"Nepal":"Kathmandu","Italy":"Rome"}
# print(captial_city)
# for i in captial_city:
#     print( captial_city[i])

#Add element to a dict:
# captial_city={"Nepal":"Kathmandu","Italy":"Rome"}
# print("Initial Dictionary:",captial_city)
# captial_city["Nepal"]="Kathmandu"
# print("Updated Dictionary:",captial_city)

#change value of Dict:
# student_id={111:"Eric",112:"Kyle",113:"Butters"}
# print("Initial Dictionary:",student_id)
# student_id[112]="Stan"
# print("Updated Dictionary:",student_id)

#Acessing elements from dict:
# student_id={111:"Eric",112:"Kyle",113:"Butters"}
# print(student_id[111])
# print(student_id[113])

#Removing elements from dict:
# student_id={111:"Eric",112:"Kyle",113:"Butters"}
# del student_id[111]
# print("Updated Dictionary",student_id)

#Iterating through a dict:
squares={1:3,3:9,5:25,7:49,9:81}
for i in squares:
    print(squares[i])


a={}
for i in range(1,11):
